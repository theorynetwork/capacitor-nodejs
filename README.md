# Capacitor Plugin for Node.js

This plugin is in early planning stages, but will be the home of a community [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) plugin to bridge Capacitor apps with Node.js libraries.

## Early Research

We are in the research phase and are reviewing the following libraries as reference to create this plugin:

- [Capacitor Community Plugins](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins/community) home
- [Cordova Node.js](https://github.com/JaneaSystems/nodejs-mobile-cordova) plugin (not maintained)
- [Capacitor Node.js](https://github.com/hampoelz/Capacitor-NodeJS) plugin (early development)
- Instructions to integrate and "nodify" the [XRP Ledger](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl.js) into React Native apps
- React Native [rn-nodify](https://github.com/tradle/rn-nodeify) shim
